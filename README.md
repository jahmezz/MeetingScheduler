MeetingScheduler

Meeting scheduler for multiple users

This is my computer engineering project that implements a meeting scheduler for many employees. A leading employee may create
a meeting and the program will automatically search the best meeting time for the date specified.

The project was written using Java Swing, MigLayout, MySQL, and uses a Model-View-Controller design pattern.

NOTE: My MySQL tables have unfortunately been lost since I completed this project, so it will not run. Feel free to view the
code, however.
